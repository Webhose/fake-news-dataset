## Introduction

Welcome to the [Webz.io](https://webz.io) Fake News Dataset Repository! This repository, created by [Webz.io](https://webz.io), provides free datasets of publicly available news articles identified as originating from **fake news websites**. Using Webz.io’s **trust filter** (`trust.category:fake_news`), we curate datasets containing articles from sources flagged as fake news sites in reputable references, including:

- [List of fake news websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites)

- [List of political disinformation website campaigns in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_disinformation_website_campaigns_in_Russia)

We release new datasets **weekly**, each containing approximately **1,000 articles** sourced from these flagged sites. These datasets provide valuable resources for researchers, analysts, and journalists studying misinformation and disinformation trends.
